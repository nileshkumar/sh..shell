#my first script
echo "Hello World !!"

#Most Linux distributions encourage a practice 
#in which each user has a specific directory for the programs he/she personally uses. 
#This directory is called bin and is a subdirectory of your home directory.

#We can add bin directory in our bash peofile:
# export PATH=$PATH:bin(name of the directory of scripts)
